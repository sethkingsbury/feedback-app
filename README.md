# React Feedback App

This is my first react project coded while following along with a react based course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/)

The project is very basic and I've used it as my introduction to using react. Below is a rough list of the concepts covered.
- components
- props, prop drilling
- hooks
- events
- component reactivity
- validation,
- input forms
- Routes w/ React Router v6
- Context (useContext hook)
- API Requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with json server

'npm run dev' in the terminal will launch the project.
'npm start' for just the front end
'npm run server' for just the back end

client runs on 'http://localhost/3000"

server runs on 'http://localhost/5000'
