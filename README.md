# React Feedback App

This is my first react project coded while following along with a react based course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/)

The project is very basic and I've used it as my introduction to using react. Below is a rough list of the concepts covered.
- components
- props, prop drilling
- hooks
- events
- component reactivity
- validation,
- input forms
- Routes w/ React Router v6
- Context (useContext hook)
- API Requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with json server

After downloading the project:

- run 'npm install'

To be able to run client and server with a single command
- run 'npm install -g concurrently'
- run 'npm run dev' to launch the project

Without Concurrently
- 'npm start' for the client<br />
- 'npm run server' for the server<br />

client runs on 'http://localhost/3000"

server runs on 'http://localhost/5000'
